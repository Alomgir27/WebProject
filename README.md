# Web Project README

This is a web project consisting of different components for both the backend and frontend parts of the application. The project is organized into the following folders:

- `server`: Contains the backend code built with Node.js for handling API requests and database connections.
- `website`: Contains the frontend code for the main website.
- `backend`: Contains the backend frontend code for the admin panel.
- `admin`: Contains the frontend code for the admin panel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB URL for database connection
- Cloudinary account and cloud name for image storage

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-folder]
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each component:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies for server
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install dependencies for website
   cd ../website
   npm install

   # Install dependencies for backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install

   # Install dependencies for admin
   cd ../admin
   npm install
   ```

3. Environment Configuration:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `server & backend` directory and set your `MONGODB_URL` and Cloudinary configuration:

     ```dotenv
     MONGODB_URL=your-mongodb-url
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

     ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on a specified port (default: 3000) and connect to the MongoDB database.

2. Start the website frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../website
   npm start
   ```

   The website frontend will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

3. Start the backend frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend frontend will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:3001.

4. Start the admin frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../admin
   npm start
   ```

   The admin frontend will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:3002.
